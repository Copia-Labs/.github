# Copia Labs

Copia Labs is a collection of public unofficial scripts, utilities, and applications that are freely available for anyone to use. None of the repos in this organization are used for any production Copia software products. Some of these are example scripts that demonstrate how to use some Copia features. Some of them are prototype or proof of concept software experiments that you are welcome to try out. Others are scripts contributed by Copia users that they have given us permission to share to anyone that might find them useful.

Feel free to star any repos that you find interesting or useful and let us know if you'd like us to integrate these features into official production Copia software products.

## Support Policy

The code in these repos is not officially supported. All issues should be filed to their respective repositories, not to the official Copia support channels. Support requests for official Copia products will generally take priority over issues and pull requests in these repos. We are not making any representations of the quality of the code in these repositories, it is just provided as-is. Some of them may be contributed by Copia users and were not written by Copia employees and we are not liable for any harm or damages from the use/misuse of this code. Some of these applications will include all of the code necessary to build and link the application, some may rely on private dependencies that are not publicly available. Feel free to fork and submit PRs for the applications whose full source code is available. Repos may be abandoned, archived, or deleted at any time, so we do not recommending relying on continued access to these repos for critical applications.

## Why is this on Github instead of Copia?

The Copia web application doesn't support public repositories at this time, so this isn't possible. The Copia Desktop application is a git client compatible with Github and so you can interact with these repositories with the Copia Desktop application if you like though.
